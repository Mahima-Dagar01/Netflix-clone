**Netflix Clone Project**
This project is a front-end replica of the Netflix website, created using only HTML and CSS.
It features a responsive layout, including a stylish header with the Netflix logo, a search bar, and user profile icons, as well as visually appealing sections for featured movies, trending shows, and personalized recommendations. The design closely mimics the original site's user interface and aesthetic.
